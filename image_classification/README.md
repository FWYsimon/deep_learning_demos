# Image Classification
This a simple example of image classification.

## Dataset
I use [cifar-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) as default dataset.

You can download the dataset by running first cell in the notebook.

### usage
Run train.py to train the model and test.py to test your model.

You can change the model defination if you are not satisfied with the accuracy. For example, making the network deeper may be a good way to improve the accuracy rate.
