# Face Generation
In this project, I use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

## Dataset
There are two datasets.

- MNIST
- CelebA

You can run the first cell of notebook and it can help you to download and extract both dataset.

### How to start
Once you have prepared the dataset, you just need to run train.py and it will generate a face after training.
